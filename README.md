# NameProgram

**FirstName**
- Read in a character from the user. The user is forced to type in one of the following  valid capital letters  {P, J, G, L}.  If they type an invalid letter, an error message is displayed and       the user is prompted again for the first letter. This repeats till they type in a correct CAPITAL letter.  Anything other than {P, J, G, L} is considered invalid.  

**Last Name**
- Another character is read in from the user, i.e. {G, B, S, T}.  The same process is used to ensure a valid character is typed in.

**n** 
- DECI is used to get a number from the user. It's assumed that the user will type in a number between -32768 and 32767.  If the user types in a number less than or equal to 0,  a message is displayed telling them to re-enter their number before moving on. This continues till they type in a positive integer.

**Ascending/Descending**
- A character is read in from the user with a capital letter {A, D}. The same processes as above are used till a valid character is typed.

The input is displayed as such:
the First Name LastName n times with either ascending or descending numbers next to each name.
